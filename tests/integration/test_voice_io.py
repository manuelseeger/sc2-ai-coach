1. **Replay from September 1, 2024, on Post-Youth LE**: aikrash used a standard Zerg build with a focus on Zerglings and Banelings transition into Roaches, but you outplayed him and secured the win.

2. **Replay from August 12, 2024, on Amphion LE**: aikrash went for a Roach-based strategy with a Lair tech and some mid-game aggression, but again, you handled it like a champ and took the victory. He didn't GG in this one either and complained about cheats at the end ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

You haven't played aikrash on Alcyone LE before, so he might try something different this time. Any questions on these games?""",
