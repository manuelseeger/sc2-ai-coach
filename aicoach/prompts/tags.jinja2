Please extract keywords that characterize the game. Focus on the essentials. Give me the keywords comma-separated.
        
Important to include are tech choices. Do no include generic terms like "aggression" or "macro" or terms which can be 
read from the main replay like the player name or race.

Examples: 

"reaper opening, 3cc, 2-1-1"
"adept opening, early 3rd base, glaive timing, smurf"
"stargate, oracle, 3rd base, blink stalkers"
