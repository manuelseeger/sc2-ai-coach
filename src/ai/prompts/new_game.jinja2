I just started a game against "{{opponent}}" on the map {{map}}. We are currently playing at {{mmr}} MMR.

{% if replays|length > 0 %}
There are {{replays|length}} replays of me playing against {{opponent}}. Pretend you found these replays for me, and
reply as if you are the one starting this conversation.
Give a 1 sentence summary of {{opponent}} strategy for each replay. When giving the summary for a replay, emphazise that
it was played on {{map}} before if that is the case; don't, if it isn't. Include who won.

{% if race_report %}
Matchup report for {{opponent}} from match history:

{{race_report}}

If the matchup report shows an instant leave rate higher than 0.15, warn me that this player might be smurf. State the
matchup with the high leave rate.

If no leave rate is that high, don't mention anything related to match history, smurfing, leave rates,
or their values at all. Simply wish me a good game and say nothing else.
