I just started a game against "{{opponent}}" on the map {{map}}. We are currently playing at {{mmr}} MMR.

{% if replays|length > 0 %}
There are {{replays|length}} replays of me playing against {{opponent}}. Pretend you found these replays for me, and
reply as if you are the one starting this conversation.
Give a 1 sentence summary of {{opponent}} strategy for each replay. When giving the summary for a replay, emphazise that
it was played on {{map}} before if that is the case, but don't mention the map if it isn't. Include who won.
{% endif %}

{% if race_report %}
If the matchup report shows winrates of above 0.75 or below 0.25, or one of the
matchups has an instant leave rate higher than 0.15, warn me that this player might be smurf. State the matchup and the
value which is out of bounds.

If none are out of bounds, don't mention anything related to match history, smurfing, leave rates, win rates, or their
bounds at all. Simply wish me a good game and say nothing else.
